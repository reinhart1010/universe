## Universe Design System

[Documentation](index.html)

### About
Universe is divided into two main components: the **User Interface (UI)** and the **User Experience (UX)**. While the **User Interface** component serves as the reference implementation of the Universe Design System, the **User Experience** component consists of general interaction patterns and practices that can be implemented where the UI could not be further enforced on certain platforms (e.g. Linux apps which uses the GTK toolkit).

### Design Principles
#### 1. Adaptable and Compatible
There is a general reason behind the release and implementation of design systems: to make a product feel acceptable and enjoyable to its users. The Universe Design System "recycles" known design patterns to allow adaptation and implementation to other platforms and design systems.

#### 2. Integrated and Interoperable
The Universe Design System recognizes multiple **design products** as a media of communication. These design products may either come in

+ **Physical Form**: signages, billboard, documents, etc.
+ **Virtual Form**: software, applications, multimedia contents, social media posts, etc.

Some of the design products (primarily physical and display) do not provide a direct **medium of feedback**. For example, you cannot perform a click on a printed hyperlink on paper to visit a website, since the paper itself is not designed to allow transfers of electronic data. The Universe Design System aims to resolve certain interoperability issues by standardizing **Read-Only and Read-Write interactions**, as well as providing an integration between design products to ensure a consistent and coherent experience between them.

#### 3. Accessible and Natural
We believe that Universe should be welcoming to everyone by implementing the same accessibility standards as found in other design systems.

#### 4. Simple and Focused
In addition to accessibility, Universe aims to provide a focused user experience by keeping simplicity in mind, both on the design specification as well as technical implementation. This will also ease developers to build and integrate their design products with Universe.

#### 5. Customizable and Reusable
Unlike certain in-house design systems that aims for coherence across a certain product, service, or company, Universe provide customization features to empower people to start designing and developing high-quality products. As a result, the Universe User Interface are open to customization for both designers and developers.

### Legacy
Universe is an evolution of a previously-rejected design proposal meant for use across digital and physical media. Unlike other design systems, Universe is now meant to adapt to different "media platforms" (e.g. operating systems, app stores, social media) while being consistent with branding and design standards.
